# Image Hash Encoder & Verifier (DDW)

This project provides a Python-based tool for image encryption and verification.  
Using SHA-256 hashing on pixel data, supporting both verification and restoration.

## üì¢ Publication Information

This work will be presented at the  
**2025 IEEE International Conference on Computation, Big-Data and Engineering (IEEE ICCBE 2025)**.

## üöÄ Features

- Image upload and `SHA-256` hash generation.
- Image verification and restoration.
- User-friendly GUI with Tkinter.

## üì¶ Installation Requirements

- Python Version: Python 3.7 or higher.
- Required libraries: `tkinter`, `pillow`, `numpy`.
**Install dependencies via:**
``` bash
pip install pillow numpy
```

## üî• Quick Start
